# SSL_Ubuntu-Debian-based-Linux-system
This project automates the setup of an Apache web server with SSL encryption using a self-signed certificate. The included setup.sh script installs Apache, generates an SSL certificate, and configures HTTPS. Ideal for testing secure connections on a local server.
